## Purpose of `printf`

- In essence, `printf` is a versatile command that allows you to format and display text in a controlled way.  It's more powerful than the simpler `echo` command, giving you fine-grained control over how the output appears.

- `printf'`s formatting capabilities offer more flexibility in the long run. If you wanted to add more complex formatting (like specific widths or padding), `printf` makes it easier to adjust.

## How it Works Here

1. **Command Substitution:**
    - The part within `$( ... )` is called command substitution.
    - It executes the `echo -e "${color}${text}${RESET}"` command and captures its output.
    - The `-e` flag enables interpretation of escape sequences (like the color codes and reset code) within the text.

2. **Formatted Printing:**
    - `printf` takes the captured output as input.
    - The command itself doesn't have a format string specified (like `%s`), so it simply prints the text it receives.
    - The newline character (`\n`) at the end ensures that each line of text is printed on a new line.

## Color Codes and Reset

- The variables `RED`, `GREEN`, etc., store escape sequences that tell the terminal to switch to a specific color.
- The `RESET` variable stores the escape sequence that returns the text color to the default.

## Functions

- `text()`: This function takes text as input and prints it centered and in a specific color (208 on the 256-color palette).
- `redtext()`: This function takes text as input and prints it centered in red.
